Participants included children and adolescents (aged <21 years) with at least 1 baseline visit (24 months to 7 days before the index date) and at least 1 follow-up visit (28 to 179 days after the index date).\\nSARS-CoV-2 infection, determined by positive laboratory test results (polymerase chain reaction, antigen, or serologic) or relevant clinical diagnoses. A comparison group included children with documented negative test results and no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\\nOutcomes included new-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 2 or higher or CKD stage 3 or higher among those without preexisting CKD; composite kidney events (≥50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], eGFR ≤15 mL/min/1.73 m2, dialysis, transplant, or end-stage kidney disease diagnosis), and at least 30%, 40%, or 50% eGFR decline among those with preexisting CKD or acute-phase AKI. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models with propensity score stratification.\\nAmong 1\\u202f900\\u202f146 pediatric patients (487\\u202f378 with and 1\\u202f412\\u202f768 without COVID-19), 969 937 (51.0%) were male, the mean (SD) age was 8.2 (6.2) years, and a range of comorbidities was represented. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with higher risk of new-onset CKD stage 2 or higher (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.12-1.22) and CKD stage 3 or higher (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13-1.62). In those with preexisting CKD, COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of composite kidney events (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.04-1.27) at 28 to 179 days. Children with acute-phase AKI had elevated HRs (1.29; 95% CI, 1.21-1.38) at 90 to 179 days for composite outcomes.\\nIn this large US cohort study of children and adolescents, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a higher risk of adverse postacute kidney outcomes, particularly among those with preexisting CKD or AKI, suggesting the need for vigilant long-term monitoring.\\nPubmed ID: 40214993\\nAuthors: [{\\'lastname\\': \\'Li\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Lu\\', \\'initials\\': \\'L\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.\\\\nThe Graduate Group in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science, School of Arts and Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Zhou\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Ting\\', \\'initials\\': \\'T\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Lu\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Yiwen\\', \\'initials\\': \\'Y\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.\\\\nThe Graduate Group in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science, School of Arts and Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Chen\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Jiajie\\', \\'initials\\': \\'J\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Lei\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Yuqing\\', \\'initials\\': \\'Y\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Wu\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Qiong\\', \\'initials\\': \\'Q\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.\\\\nDepartment of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Arnold\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Jonathan\\', \\'initials\\': \\'J\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Becich\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Michael J\\', \\'initials\\': \\'MJ\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Bisyuk\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Yuriy\\', \\'initials\\': \\'Y\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'Office of Research, University Medical Center New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Blecker\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Saul\\', \\'initials\\': \\'S\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'Department of Population Health, NYU (New York University) Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Chrischilles\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Elizabeth\\', \\'initials\\': \\'E\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, University of Iowa, Iowa City.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Christakis\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Dimitri A\\', \\'initials\\': \\'DA\\', \\'affiliation\\': \"Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development, Seattle Children\\'s Research Institute, Seattle, Washington.\"}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Geary\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Carol Reynolds\\', \\'initials\\': \\'CR\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Jhaveri\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Ravi\\', \\'initials\\': \\'R\\', \\'affiliation\\': \"Division of Infectious Diseases, Ann & Robert H.

       " ('Title: Trends in Abortion Rates in Ontario, Canada.\\nAbstract: Following decades-long declines, significant increases in abortion rates have been reported in some jurisdictions from 2020 to 2023, but it is not yet known whether these trends are occurring in Canada.\\nTo assess abortion rates in Ontario from 2012 to 2022 and to examine trend changes associated with mifepristone availability, the COVID-19 pandemic, and postpandemic periods.\\nThis population-based interrupted time series cohort study examined all medication and procedural abortions provided in Ontario from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2022, to females aged 15 to 44 years with provincial insurance coverage, identified using linked health administrative data that included records from practitioner billings, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, same-day surgeries, and outpatient prescription dispensations.\\nAvailability of mifepristone regulated as a normal (ie, prescribed by an authorized prescriber without additional certification or registration and dispensed by a pharmacist) prescription medication (in November 2017) and the COVID-19 pandemic period (from March 2020 to December 2021).\\nThe main outcome was the abortion rate (number of abortions per 1000 females per year) overall and within age strata, using an interrupted time series design.\\nOf 422 867 medication and procedural abortions identified using data from health records of 225 540 reproductive-aged females (mean [SD] age, 28.5 [6.6] years), the abortion rate declined steadily from 15.6 abortions per year per 1000 females, aged 15 to 44 years, in 2012 to 12.3 in 2021 and then increased to 14.1 in 2022. When mifepristone was introduced in 2017 as a normal prescription medication, no immediate change in the abortion rate (-0.1 [95% CI, -0.7 to 0.8]) and a nonsignificant slope increase (0.6 [95% CI, -0.5 to 0.7]) were found. However, this trend resulted in an additional 1.5 (95% CI, 0.3-2.6) abortions per 1000 females by the first quarter of 2020 compared with premifepristone trends; rates increased more among those aged 15 to 19 years, less among those aged 35 to 44 years, and did not increase for those aged 25 to 29 years. During the pandemic period, abortion rates decreased by 1.2 (95% CI, -2.5 to -0.8), most pronounced among those aged 20 to 34 years. Compared with expected rates based on premifepristone trends, 5-year availability of normally prescribed mifepristone was associated with a rate difference of 1.9 (95% CI, 0.7-5.4) in 2022, with a greater increase among those aged 20 to 24 years (4.2 [95% CI, 1.5-9.0]) and no change among those aged 25 to 29 years (1.0 [95% CI, -1.7 to 6.2]). The increased abortion rate in 2022 was consistent with 5-year trends following normally prescribed mifepristone, although social forces potentially impacting international rates may have contributed.\\nThis study found that, following longstanding declines, abortion rates in Ontario gradually increased with mifepristone availability in 2017 in Ontario. Following a pandemic-related decrease in rates (in 2020 and 2021), substantial increases in abortion rates reported elsewhere from 2020 to 2023 did not occur in Ontario as of 2022, suggesting that Ontario\\'s health services environment and Canada\\'s regulatory and policy approach to preserving reproductive health services may have helped stabilize abortion rates. Future research is needed to understand how sociocultural changes affecting abortion service use elsewhere may be affecting contraception access and use and thus abortion rates in Canada.\\nPubmed ID: 40214991\\nAuthors: [{\\'lastname\\': \\'Schummers\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Laura\\', \\'initials\\': \\'L\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'Collaboration for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Dunn\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Sheila\\', \\'initials\\': \\'S\\', \\'affiliation\\': \"Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\\\\nWomen\\'s College Research Institute, Women\\'s College Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\"}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Cheng\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Lucy\\', \\'initials\\': \\'L\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'School of Population and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\\'}, {\\'lastname\\': \\'Norman\\', \\'firstname\\': \\'Wendy V\\', \\'initials\\': \\'WV\\', \\'affiliation\\': \\'Department of Family Practice, Faculty of Medicine, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\\\\nDepartment of Public Health, Environments and Society, Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.\\'}]',\n",

Changes in the demographic characteristics, disease severity, and outcomes of patients were observed, which could impact the identification of risk groups for interventions aimed at reducing the severity of RSV disease.\\nTo identify factors associated with severe clinical outcomes among children hospitalized with RSV-associated ARIs in 2022 and 2023.\\nThis observational cohort study, conducted at 2 large, Canadian, tertiary-level pediatric hospitals, comprised all 709 cases of RSV-associated ARI among children younger than 18 years who were admitted to the hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023.\\nDiagnosis of RSV-associated ARI.\\nThe primary outcome of severe disease was defined as requiring noninvasive or invasive ventilation or death. Risk factors for severe disease and ICU admission (secondary outcome) were assessed using multivariable Poisson regression, and results were reported as adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) with 95% CIs, with age-stratified models (<2 years and ≥2 years).\\nA total of 709 cases (median age, 13.1 months [IQR, 2.0-36.6 months]; 442 boys [62.3%]) were admitted with RSV-associated ARI; 452 (63.8%) were younger than 2 years, and 257 (36.2%) were aged 2 years or older. Severe disease was documented for 204 cases (28.8%). Patients with severe disease were younger than those with nonsevere disease (median age, 2.6 months [IQR, 1.3-16.0 months] vs 18.6 months [IQR, 4.5-39.1 months]; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). Pulmonary disease and use of home oxygen (ARR, 2.47 [95% CI, 1.30-4.68]) and neurologic, neuromuscular, and developmental conditions (ARR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.03-3.49]) were associated with severe disease among children aged 2 years or older. Among children younger than 2 years, age younger than 3 months (ARR, 2.34 [95% CI, 1.43-3.84]), age 3 to less than 6 months (ARR, 2.79 [95% CI, 1.65-4.70]), and prematurity (ARR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.03-1.89]) were associated with severe disease.\\nIn this cohort study of children hospitalized with RSV in 2022 and 2023, severe RSV disease was more likely among those aged 2 years or older with pulmonary and neurologic, neuromuscular, or developmental conditions. For children younger than 2 years, age younger than 6 months and prematurity were the main risk factors. These findings support prevention strategies for all younger children, including premature infants, with potential benefit for children aged 2 years or older in specific high-risk groups.\\nPubmed ID:

       " (\"Title: Resettled refugee parent and young adult perspectives on mental health after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nAbstract: Refugees and other New Americans faced unique mental health barriers before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reduced access to mental health supports and services in this population indicates a need for new community-based mental health interventions.\\nThis paper explored refugee parents' and young adults' perceptions of the mental health barriers and facilitators encountered by young resettled refugees (ages 10-24) and their parents.\\nUsing an interpretive phenomenology approach and a form of community-based participatory research (CBPR), we designed a focus group guide with student community members from various refugee and immigrant communities. We held eight gender- and language-concordant focus groups with refugee parents, and four gender-concordant focus groups with refugee young adults (18-24), facilitated by student community members. Translated transcripts were analyzed for major themes using an iterative emergent thematic coding approach.\\nThe conversations in these focus groups were wide-ranging. Here we explore the themes and subthemes that emerged in three primary areas: the effects of COVID-19 on mental health, mental health stigma and other social barriers to mental health, and community strengths and strategies for addressing mental health.\\nCOVID-19 surfaced and intensified existing mental health challenges within resettled refugee communities. Community-based mental health interventions should be designed in partnership with the communities they aim to serve. The findings of this study suggest several possible intervention points to support refugee youth and parent mental health, including culturally sensitive group and individual therapy in a trusted community setting.\\nPubmed ID: 40214927\\n34406494\\n33516424\\n35772771\\n36628805\\n32956381\\n32478552\\n34565947\\n30067441\\n16476137\\n527699\\n37009112\\n18558310\\n22386617\\n38434037\\n27507761\\n30286763\\n33140040\\n35125223\\n24566506\\n31999504\\n25384000\\n11327142\\n21884078\\n17154740\\n26399492\\nAuthors: [{'lastname': 'Fabi', 'firstname': 'Rachel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Center for Bioethics and Humanities, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, USA. fabir@upstate.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Campagna', 'firstname': 'Christina D', 'initials': 'CD', 'affiliation': 'Upstate Global Health Institute, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Aljabarrin', 'firstname': 'Nidaa', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Upstate Global Health Institute, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Olojakpoke', 'firstname': 'Eloho', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Alghazeer', 'firstname': 'Noora', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Syracuse University, Syracuse, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Alamarie', 'firstname': 'Sana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Alamarie', 'firstname': 'Warood', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rubinstein', 'firstname': 'Robert A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Saletsky', 'firstname': 'Ron', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Shaw', 'firstname': 'Andrea V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, USA.'}]\",\n",
